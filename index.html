        <h1>&#128075; Jeffisa here :)</h1>
        <p>
            I was a Structure Engineer for a year after I graduated from ITB as a B.Sc of Ocean Enginnering at 2012 who interested in product design.
            It all started when I continued my study as a master's degree student in Taiwan. I took a Construction Management as my major. </br></br>
            During my final script, I need to develop a website. The challenge here was understanding the programming language and design flow including the interface by myself.
            The result was still amazed me because the design worked well for a heavy content such as number submission & calculation algorithm.
            At that time, I knew that I want to learn more about product design.</br></br>

                            To provide the best experience for users during the payday period, Traveloka Indonesia offers promotions across 6 products. These promotions appear as cards under the promotion menu, featuring a mix of both related and unrelated payday promotions. To prevent an overwhelming number of cards on the promotion page, the marketing team aims to consolidate all related payday promotions into a single card. This approach ensures that all promotion pages related to payday are seamlessly combined into one entrance under the promotion menu.

                        This project has several requirements to be met. Firstly, each Traveloka product will offer multiple promotions. Secondly, these promotions will encompass both domestic and international travel.

                        To address this needs, the initial consideration is to create a structured section, resembling a table, with each product in Y-axis and accommodate promotions for both domestic and international travel in X-axis.

                        The initial design faced a setback as users mistakenly clicked on the non-clickable product box on the left, disrupted the intended flow. Consequently, users exited the page, leading to a drop in promotion sales.

                        This served as a valuable lesson, prompting me to recover with an iteration design for the subsequent payday promotion. The revamped design proved highly successful, remaining in use until the conclusion of the promotion payday plan.

                        While the original layout idea was designed by the Traveloka Malaysia design team, I contributed to achieving a seamless design by sketching a low-fi wireframe and reducing the page height. This approach aimed to bring a unique and different feel compared to the standard campaign page, with the benefit of decreasing the scroll time for user to access content quickly.
                        </br></br>
                        As for attractive view, I recommended incorporating different shape for the header image, a full background image using a light illustration, and a one-line illustration before the footer section.

                        To enhance accessibility, the platform was migrated to the company's general tools, specifically Google Workspace. This change ensures that all individuals within Traveloka can access the link without restrictions.

                        In terms of the system flow, I synchronized Google Spreadsheet, Google Calendar, and Google Form to establish an automatic system. Google Spreadsheet functions as an online library or book database, Google Form serves as the platform to submit requests to borrow available books, and Google Calendar acts as a reminder in the borrower’s calendar, indicating when the book should be returned.
                        </br></br>
                        The initial step to borrow a book involves submitting data through Google Form. Subsequently, users are not required to take any action in the book database, as the information from Google Form is automatically transferred to Google Spreadsheet, updating the book status in the database. Along with the process, the modified status in the book database then triggers an auto-reminder on the borrower's calendar.

                        I explored the business world with my business partner by establishing a service-oriented business as a side job. I served as a content creator, brand designer, graphic designer, and photographer. 
                        </br></br>
                        As a content creator, I crafted design concept, taglines, narratives, and captions for each post. In my capacity as a brand designer, I created logos, product labels, and product amenities. Additionally, as a graphic designer and a photographer, I developed cohesive designs for static image and moving image for story by combining photos with graphic elements.
                        </br></br>
                        This job was active during festive occasion like Christmas, Chinese New Year, Valentine’s Day, and Hari Raya. However, the business has closed permanently.
